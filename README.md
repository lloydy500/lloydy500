Hi I'm Lloyd. Thanks for checking out my profile.

🏨 I've developed a web app for a hotel that improves operational efficiency for hotel management, reception and cleaners by live monitoring of  both guest and cleaning activities in hotel rooms. I hope that one day it will be used in all hotels :)

🔒 Right now I'm working on a reputation management tool for sports people. I'm using some libraries that only exist in Python so as of 25/05 2021 looks like I'm learning Django!

🎓 I graduated from Le Wagon coding bootcamp course in December 2020 and now I'm developing full-time.

🎸Fun fact: I play guitar! Check out our band here: https://open.spotify.com/track/2iwOVD71bq3mVxaXXMqRpa
