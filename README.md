Hi I'm Lloyd. Thanks for checking out my profile.


🎓 graduated from Le Wagon web development course in December 2020.

🏨 I've since finshed a Housekeeping web app for a hotel.   

🔒 Right now I'm working on a staff rota system alongside a reputation management tool but they're private repos

🎸Fun fact: I play guitar! Check out our band here: https://open.spotify.com/track/2iwOVD71bq3mVxaXXMqRpa
