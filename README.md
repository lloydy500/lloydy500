Hi I'm Lloyd. Thanks for checking out my profile.

I'm a fullstack web developer currently working on a task management app that allows hotel housekeepers to connect with reception.
The repo for this project is private for now but happy to show the app/code to tech recruiters.

- ðŸŒ± I graduated from Le Wagon web development course in December 2020.
- ðŸ”­ Freelancing now but on the lookout for the right full-time role.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking also to collaborate with other engineers and designers on web projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making music! Check out our band here: https://open.spotify.com/track/2iwOVD71bq3mVxaXXMqRpa
