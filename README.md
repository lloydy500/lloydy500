Hi I'm Lloyd. Thanks for checking out my profile.


- I graduated from Le Wagon web development course in December 2020.
- I've since finshed a Housekeeping web app for a hotel.   
- Right now I'm working on a staff rota system alongside a reputation management tool.
- Fun fact: I love making music! Check out our band here: https://open.spotify.com/track/2iwOVD71bq3mVxaXXMqRpa
